This fan installs differently than all the other ceiling fans I have installed. It is assembled PRIOR to hanging it from the ceiling, so you don't have to balance on a high ladder while attaching blades, etc. You just have to climb the ladder to screw in the hanger and then you insert the downrod, connect the wiring, raise the canopy and you're done! The blade design is a modern rectangular shape that fits flush with the motor body, no old-fashioned spindly arms extending from the motor to the fan blades. The first picture shows the blades attached to the pieces that later attach to the motor. Each blade is attached with three screws with washers that are included in the kit. The side of the blade you are viewing in that picture shows the top side of the blades, which is a weathered wood finish. I wanted the black finished side to show when the fan is mounted, and it is underneath. The second picture shows how the blades are attached to the motor. The cardboard packing that came with the fan makes an excellent base to hold the motor securely and you can see it in the second picture. Here, the motor is upside down, and you see what will be the exposed side of the blades. This position is also used to install the light unit, which went on next. THe camera made the blade surface look brown, but it is a black, woodgrain finish. Then, I turned the assembly right side up and still on top of that cardboard packing, installed the downrod and canopy. The fan came with a 6" downrod - if you need something longer, extensions are available, but be sure you get one that is specified for a DC - powered fan! Finally, I had to climb a ladder to attach the ceiling hanger, which was easy, and then I climbed the ladder again, holding the assembled fan in one hand to insert the downrod into the hanger. The fan is fairly light, and I'm 81 years old, and I had no trouble doing this task. The only fiddly bit was inserting the transformer into the hanger, because the clearances are small. You then connect three wires with the included wire nuts, plug the transformer into the fan motor, raise the canopy and you're done! The last picture shows the fan in operation. The fan paired with the remote immediately. The light can be adjusted to different brightness levels and color intensities, from daylight to soft light, all from the remote. Likewise, the remote turns the fan on and off, changes its speed and reverses it when the seasons change. There's even a "random varying speed" feature, that is supposed to resemble a soft breeze. The fan is dead quiet and there is NO wobble, at any speed.",a91ad94e-790c-4565-8e4f-ff167951c84e

This fan installs differently than all the other ceiling fans I have installed. It is assembled PRIOR to hanging it from the ceiling, so you don't have to balance on a high ladder while attaching blades, etc. You just have to climb the ladder to screw in the hanger and then you insert the downrod, connect the wiring, raise the canopy and you're done! The blade design is a modern rectangular shape that fits flush with the motor body, no old-fashioned spindly arms extending from the motor to the fan blades. The first picture shows the blades attached to the pieces that later attach to the motor. Each blade is attached with three screws with washers that are included in the kit. The side of the blade you are viewing in that picture shows the top side of the blades, which is a weathered wood finish. I wanted the black finished side to show when the fan is mounted, and it is underneath. The second picture shows how the blades are attached to the motor. The cardboard packing that came with the fan makes an excellent base to hold the motor securely and you can see it in the second picture. Here, the motor is upside down, and you see what will be the exposed side of the blades. This position is also used to install the light unit, which went on next. THe camera made the blade surface look brown, but it is a black, woodgrain finish. Then, I turned the assembly right side up and still on top of that cardboard packing, installed the downrod and canopy. The fan came with a 6" downrod - if you need something longer, extensions are available, but be sure you get one that is specified for a DC - powered fan! Finally, I had to climb a ladder to attach the ceiling hanger, which was easy, and then I climbed the ladder again, holding the assembled fan in one hand to insert the downrod into the hanger. The fan is fairly light, and I'm 81 years old, and I had no trouble doing this task. The only fiddly bit was inserting the transformer into the hanger, because the clearances are small. You then connect three wires with the included wire nuts, plug the transformer into the fan motor, raise the canopy and you're done! The last picture shows the fan in operation. The fan paired with the remote immediately. The light can be adjusted to different brightness levels and color intensities, from daylight to soft light, all from the remote. Likewise, the remote turns the fan on and off, changes its speed and reverses it when the seasons change. There's even a "random varying speed" feature, that is supposed to resemble a soft breeze. The fan is dead quiet and there is NO wobble, at any speed.",587a2e80-d176-4c85-9fbb-f16228c9db93

It’s putting out significantly BETTER BREEZE (60” vs. original 52” span), MORE EFFICIENT (variable LED vs. original incandescent lights; DC motor with multi-speeds vs. original 3-speed AC motor). Comparing a DC to AC motor ceiling fan: DC uses up to 70% less energy than a standard AC fan and are EXTREMELY QUIET. The quality is good, wood blades balanced on first go. The remote is much handier than our old pullchain/switch operation; the LEDs have variable color to match our recessed lighting; and there’s even an app for “smart” use. VERY SATISFIED with all these improvements! The installation guide is available on the HD website. We had to purchase a 3-ft Carro-brand downrod from Home Depot for our application (it’s a different diameter from a standard downrod). We found it at CARRO 36 in. Black Extension downrod for DC Ceiling Fan DR36B (homedepot.com). We figured it out, but it came with no instructions- we had to remove the ball from the included 6-in rod and shorten the mounting pin. The 3-ft downrod came with an extended wiring harness and a longer safety cable but a different design than the included shorter cable ends. FYI, using the 3-ft downrod places the bottom of the blades at 3’8” and the bottom of the light at 3’10”. Contrary to the assembly instructions, we opted to do the installation without the blades and light kit attached (we were working on a 12-ft stepladder and it would have been unwieldy).",d576a0bb-cb57-4ac4-a5ac-d9d695667fc5

This particular fan does not hang down as low as some of the fans. This was the main reason for trying this one. The fan that was there was flush mounted instead of hanging from a pole. Another thing I like about these fans are the LED lights. You can run it with White, Yellow and Both. So if you need the softer tones, you can do that. If you want a bright white/daylight, do that. Or run them both for a good amount of light from the LED fixture. Installation is easy. The ground wire attaches to the mounting bracket. The neutral and common wires are the only ones connected to a control box. From that control box, there is a connector. This makes it easy to install the box prior and then connecting the fan. It also has the support/safety cable. So as far as installation for a fan, it is straightforward and easy. My favorite feature is the real wood used in the blades.
